# Ellie Lockhart, Software & Data Developer
## Personal Website & Portfolio

Welcome to the personal website & portfolio of Ellie Lockhart, software & data developer. Ever since I got my first personal computer (a Mac SE older than I was!) at the age of nine, I've wanted to work with software & data. Data runs in my family - my mother was the author of a textbook on the nearly-forgotten scientific programming language FORTH, & I was always encouraged in my interests. As an adult, I went into research professionally and spent seven years working on data research as an employee of the states of, first, Texas, and then, New Jersey. Today I work as a freelance/independent data & software developer, and am seeking to expand my professional horizons.

### Professional Interests
I wrote my first line of BASIC at the age of nine, on the aforementioned Mac SE, and my first line of Python at 10 when involved in a hobby project involving a long-forgotten adventure game development engine. Picking up new development skills, whether that means new programming languages, new database architectures, or entirely new modes of software development like Agile and microservices, is one of my passions. I use technology to accomplish goals, whether those goals are working with a team, completing academic research & publication, or developing my own passion project. The things I am particularly enthusiastic about working on include:
